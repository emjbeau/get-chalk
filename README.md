Using the provided data source, I created a WordPress plugin that displays NFL teams grouped by conference and then by division. 
I use an object-oriented approach using PHP7 language features. The output is generated via a shortcode. The plugin source is available from my Github repository.

Finally, I added interactivity to the output. I created two buttons for filter the data. The Division button will display the teams by conference and then by division. The Conference button will display the teams by conference only.

To use this plugin, download the project zip file from Github. Add the zip file to your plugings via your site's WordPress dashboard. Create a new post or page and in the WYSIWYG text editor, type the shortcode [getchalk].
